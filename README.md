# vimrc

This repository consists of configuration for vi(m). I use within my Linux (Mint) and Vim development environment. I use my terminal as my IDE, so there's a lot of tools I depend on.

Install this vimrc manually
1. Clone this repo:
git clone git@github.com:darwin301194/vimrc.git
2. Exec
sh ~/vimrc/install.sh
